# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This project is a simple, static personal website or blog. It is built with plain HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript. The styling is responsive, with separate styles for mobile devices.

The main page (`index.html`) features a hero section, an "About Me" section with a profile picture, and some placeholder text. The JavaScript in `index.js` handles a simple scroll effect for a down arrow icon.

## Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process required.

To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

There are no formal development conventions established for this project. The code is straightforward and does not use any frameworks or build tools.
